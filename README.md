# EXP.NO.3.-IMPLEMENTATION-OF-DELTA-MODULATION

3.Implementation of Delta Modulation 
  
## AIM    
 To study the Delta modulation using the Delta Modulation trainer kit. 
 
## APPARATUS REQUIRED
Trainer Kit, DSO(10MHz) , Patch Cords and Power Supply (0-30V)   

## PROCEDURE

Initial Setup:

Connect the Delta Modulation trainer kit to the power supply (set within 0–30V range as per kit specification).

Switch on the power supply and ensure the trainer kit powers up properly.

Signal Configuration:

Use the patch cords to connect the input signal (usually a sine wave) to the modulator input of the trainer kit.

Verify the frequency and amplitude of the input signal as per the trainer kit’s manual or lab instructions.

Connecting the DSO:

Connect the Digital Storage Oscilloscope (DSO) probes to:

Channel 1: Input Analog Signal (modulating signal).

Channel 2: Delta Modulated Signal (output from the modulator).

Observe Waveforms:

Switch on the DSO and observe the analog input and delta modulated output signals.

Adjust time and voltage scales for clarity.

Note the step-by-step approximation of the analog signal in the modulated output.

Demodulation (if included):

If the kit includes a demodulator circuit, connect the delta modulated signal to the demodulator input.

Observe the reconstructed analog signal on another DSO channel and compare it with the original input.
